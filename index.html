 Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An alternative definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition. </p>

  	<br>

  In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants that is formed from the ovary after flowering.

  Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate their seeds. </p></div>

  	<br>

  Tubers are enlarged structures used as storage organs for nutrients in some plants. They are used for the plant's perennation (survival of the winter or dry months), to provide energy and nutrients for regrowth during the next growing season, and as a means of asexual reproduction.</p></div>
